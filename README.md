## Pre-requisites

> NOTE: You'll need to use the command line to work with Newport, if you're not familar with the command line we recommend following the short _Git Tower Command Line 101_ tutorial: https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/en/command-line/appendix/command-line-101

You'll need the following installed:

- Install Git: https://git-scm.com/downloads
- Install Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- Install gulp-cli - after installing the above open your command prompt and run `npm install --global gulp-cli`

## Quick start

Clone the project with

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vlocityinc/newport-design-system.git
```

Change into the `newport-design-system` folder using

```bash
cd newport-design-system
```

(optional) Switch to the right branch for your version of the Salesforce package, for example

```bash
git checkout ins-108.0
```

## Docs

For more indepth documentation please checkout the _documentation_ section in storybook.

## Browser compatibility

We support the latest versions of all browsers and IE 11.

### Generating the zip to deploy

When you have an updated version of Newport that you're happy with and want to test in an org you can run the following command:

```bash
npm run build && npm run dist
```

This will generate a zipped up version to be uploaded into Salesforce in the `dist` folder in your workspace.

If you also want to deploy it to an org then run it with the following env variables:

```bash
SF_USERNAME=myusername@email.com SF_PASSWORD=mypassword SF_LOGINURL=myLoginUrl npm run dist
```
If the SF_LOGINURL argument is not passed, then it defaults to https://login.salesforce.com


## Troubleshooting

### npm and Node.js

The Vlocity Newport Design System uses `npm` to manage dependencies. Please [install Node.js](https://nodejs.org), and try running `npm install` again.

If Node.js is already installed, make sure youâ€™re running v8 or up.

### JavaScript and compilation issues

JavaScript dependencies sometimes get out of sync and inexplicable bugs start to happen. Follow these steps to give a fresh start to your development environment:

1. The installed `npm` version must be at least v3.10. You can update your npm with: `npm install npm -g` (`sudo` may be required).
2. Re-install dependencies: `rm -Rf node_modules && npm install`
3. `npm start`

If this did not work, try running `npm cache clean` and repeat the above steps.
