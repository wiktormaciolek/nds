# Feeds

A feed consists of a list of recurring elements of similar types. Examples of a feed would be a discussion feed.

## Accessibility

Most feeds have a media object containing the user's name and avatar image.
If both the image and the name link to the same location, add `tab-index="-1"`
to the `<a>` element so that assistive technology does not read out
duplicate links.
