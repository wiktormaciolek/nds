# Tiles

A tile is a grouping of related information associated with a record.

Tiles are setup to be displayed with or without an image/icon. The default
pattern for tiles has an image/icon, a detail body which contains a list of
information and action overflow menu dropdown. The detail body list, by
default, comes as a name/value pairing but can be swapped out with a string
of text or an inline horizontal list.

Tiles can have different groupings of information based on its context.
Pay close attention to the markup, as each tile layout is constructed differently.
