# Publishers

A publisher is an advanced longform text input form element.

To initialize the publisher, apply the `.nds-publisher` class to a containing
`<div>`. The publisher consists of, but not limited to, a text input form
element that is either a plain text or rich text editor. A row of actionable
interactions, such as attaching additional content, adding followers and a submit button.

The variants of the publishers have different use cases, so please pay attention
to the markup structure of each.
