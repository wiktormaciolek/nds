/**
 * The comment publisher is found at the bottom of a discussion feed comment
 * thread. It contains basic publishing capibilities.
 *
 * The comment publisher is in a collapsed state by default. There are 4 states
 * of the discussion feed that provide different feedback to the user. First,
 * the collapsed state, this indicates the user has not interacted with the
 * comment publisher. When the user initiates an interaction with the publisher,
 * by either focusing of the textara or clicking the "Comment" button, through
 * javascript the class of `nds-is-active` should be applied to the
 * `nds-publisher` element. This class will expand the publisher box and
 * display additional publisher actions.
 *
 * Due to the implementation of the comment publisher design, we used a faux
 * textarea container and we'll need to apply the our focus state to that custom
 * container. Using javascript, the class `nds-has-focus` should be applied to
 * the `nds-publisher` element when the user interacts with `<textarea>`. When
 * the user loses focus on the `<textarea>`, the class `nds-has-focus` should
 * be toggled off from the `nds-publisher` element.
 *
 * During the active state, before the user has begun typing or attaching
 * additional content, the "Comment" button should be disabled by applying the
 * `disabled` attribute to the `<textarea>`. When the user begins typing, the
 * `disabled` attribute should be toggled off.
 *
 * @summary Initiates publisher that is specific to commenting in threads
 *
 * @name comment
 * @selector .nds-publisher_comment
 * @restrict .nds-publisher
 * @required
 * @variant
