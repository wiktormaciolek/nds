# Activity Timeline

The activity timeline displays each of the userâ€™s upcoming, current, and past activities.

Each Activity timeline item receives its width from the parent list. It can
consume the full width of the main page area or be placed in the smaller right
sidebar.

## Accessibility

Text describing the type of timeline item is placed in a `span`. It is the
first element in the timeline item and should be hidden with the
`.nds-assistive-text` class. The `SVG` image does not need the
`.nds-assistive-text` class.
