# Card

Cards are used to apply a container around a related grouping of information.

To initialize a card, apply the `.nds-card` class to a containing `<article>`.
A card is made up of three sections, a header, a body, and a footer.
The card header will get the `.nds-card__header` class.
The card body will get the `.nds-card__body` class. The card footer will
get the `.nds-card__footer` class.
