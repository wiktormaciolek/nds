# Select

Select element presents a menu of options.

The HTML `<select>` element presents a menu of options. The options within
the menu are represented by `<option>` elements that you can group with
`<optgroup>` elements. You can pre-select options for the user.

For a multiple options selections, adding the attribute `multiple` to
the `<select>` will enable this functionality. Note, if you need multiple
option selections, you will need to remove the
`<div class="nds-select_container">` from the DOM, otherwise you'll get
display issues.
