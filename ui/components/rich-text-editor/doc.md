# Rich Text Editor

The Rich Text Editor is a textarea with added capabilities for use in various publishers.

At a high-level, the buttons in RTE are organized into four groupings:
“format text”, “format body”, “insert content”, and “clear formatting”.

The “clear formatting” button always stays at the end of the buttons set,
regardless of which rich text editor variant is used. It should always stand by itself.

## Accessibility

Ensure that there is a single tab key stop for the button groups in the
toolbar, and that left and right arrows are used to navigate through each button.
