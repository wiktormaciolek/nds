# Text

For consistent typography throughout the application, we created text helper classes for headings and body&nbsp;text.

In our framework, all headings (`h1`&ndash;`h6`)
are reset to the base (body text) size, with margins and padding reset
to zero. When building an enterprise application, the heading level may vary
depending on the context of the component or page. Using the correct
heading level is important for&nbsp;accessibility.

The text helper classes help maintain visual hierarchy separately from
the structural markup hierarchy.
