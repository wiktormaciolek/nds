# Float

To float an element on the left, add the `.nds-float_left` class to the element. To float it on the right, add the `.nds-float_right` class.

Note: The floated element must be first in the document flow, even if it renders on the right.

If you want the parent of the floated element to contain the floats, add the `.nds-clearfix` class to the parent.
