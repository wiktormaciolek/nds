# Margin

Adjust whitespace with horizontal and vertical spacing helpers

Spacing indicates `margin` and `padding`. The base unit of all our spacing metrics is **4**.

- Most components already come with spacing included. These utility classes are for added convenience in laying out components.
- Classes prefixed by `.nds-m-` are used for adding **margins**. Classes prefixed in `.nds-p-` are used for adding **padding**
- The directions available for the spacing classes are `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left`.
- You can use the `vertical` shortcut for both `top` and `bottom`, `horizontal` for both `right` and `left`, and `around` for all sides.
- Use the `_xxx-small` through `_xx-large` scale to choose the size needed.
- Where **vertical centering** is required, check out our [/components/utilities/media-objects/#center](centered media object) instead of applying extra `margin` or `padding`.
