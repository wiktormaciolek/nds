# Scrollable

Make a containing box scrollable when scrolling is available.

Use the scrollable utility when you need to provide scrolling within a section of a page. For example, when the content within an element exceeds either the width or height of the element, applying `.nds-scrollable_y` provides a vertical scrollbar, while `.nds-scrollable_x` adds a horizontal scrollbar.
